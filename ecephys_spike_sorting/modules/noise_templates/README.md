Noise Templates
==============
Identifies noise (putative non-neural) units in Kilosort outputs.

The most recent version uses a pre-trained [random forest classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) to identify noise templates. A pickle file containing the classifier object is included in this repository.

The classifier was trained on manually annotated templates assigned to one of five categories: 'good' units and four types of 'noise' units (see `images` sub-folder for examples). `template_classifier_app.py` can be used to generate new training data (requires PyQt5). Once the training data is available, `train_classifier.py` was used to create the classifier object. Because there are generally many more 'good' units than 'noise' units, we reduced the number of 'good' templates in the training set in order to lower the false positive rate. In this iteration, the classifier performs with a hit rate of 99.2% ('good' units correctly identified) and a false positive rate of 12.3% ('noise' units identified as 'good'). False positives may be filtered out at a later step based on the metrics calculated by the `mean_waveforms` module. 

Running
-------
```
python -m ecephys_spike_sorting.modules.noise_templates --input_json <path to input json> --output_json <path to output json>
```
Two arguments must be included:
1. The location of an existing file in JSON format containing a list of paths and parameters.
2. The location to write a file in JSON format containing information generated by the module while it was run.

See the `_schemas.py` file for detailed information about the contents of the input JSON.


Input data
